# Restaurant-Ordering-App

## Description
-I created this to practice my javascript and css   
-It is the final solo project in the scrimba curriculum called next level javascript   
-It allowed me to using event delegation and making functions that only serve one purpose
-It also allowed me to practice creating a modal which I hadn't done since the last modal project I made

## Required
-Code editor (Visual Studio Code recommended)  

## Installation
-Download the files from Github  
-Open them in a code editor of your choice (or with a text editor like notepad)    
-Preview them like you normally would (if using visual studio code use an extension like live server)    

## Usage
-Simple restaurant ordering app  

## Features
-It is a list of three items with different prices
-You are able to add one of each item and purchase it
-Once you hit pay it will display a screen to enter your information
-Once the information is entered and you pay now you will be told that it is being processed
